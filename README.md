## How to

`npm install`

`npm run rollup` - this will build a dist/ folder with components

Check the `rollup.config.js` for configuring the build.

# Notes

- Although there is a build, I can't make it work to be imported in another project.

- There is no tailwind or twin.macro in this repo. It can be easily added after we figure out the building process.
